Programming Assignment 2-5
Write a program (called Prog5) that asks the user to input a String. The output is the
characters of this String in reverse order, which should be written to the console. 
(For example, if the input string is "Hello", the ouptut string would be "olleH".) 
(Do not use arrays and do not create a new String object. In particular, 
you may not use Java library functions that peform the reverse operation for you, 
such as the reverse functions found in StringBuilder and StringBuffer.)

For this project we use TDD
I created:
App Class -> where is the main
Prog5 Class _> to reverse the word
ConsoleInput class -> to revese the work entered through console

In the Test Cases you can see the TDD process step by step.
